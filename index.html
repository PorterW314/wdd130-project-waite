        <p class="para1">Piano and gaming may seem like very different hobbies, but both play an important role in my life. Playing the piano helps me slow down, focus, and express creativity through music. Whether I'm learning a new piece or practicing something familiar, piano gives me a meaningful and relaxing break from everyday routine.</p>
        <p class="para2">Gamingm on the other hand, challenges my quick thinking, strategy, and teamwork. I enjoy exploring different game genres, improving my skills, and connecting with friends online. It's a hobby that keeps me engaged and exited, offering new experiences every time I play.</p>
        <p class="para3">This website highlights the parts of each hobby that matter to me the most. You can explore the Piano page to learn about the music I enjoy, or visit the Gamming page to see the games and styles that interest me. Both hobbies help shape how I learn, relax, and grow.</p>
